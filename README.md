# ILC_scRNAseq
Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data from innate lympoid cells. 

All code required to reproduce the main figures of the paper “The heterogeneity of human CD127+ innate lymphoid cells revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing” Björklund, Forkel et al.

The first part of the code relates to transcriptome analysis and is included in [ILC_scRNA_analysis.html](ILC_scRNA_analysis.html) and data files are located in folder [data](data).

The second part is protein flow cytometry analysis of ILC3 cells, written by Jakob Theorell. For that analysis the script [ILC3_Flow_Cytometry_tSNE.r](ILC3_Flow_Cytometry_tSNE.r) and data files in [data/FACS_raw_protein_data_ILC.zip](data/FACS_raw_protein_data_ILC.zip) are needed.
